<h3 class="editable">Public Safety through Policy Reform </h3>

<p class="editable">The Mayor’s Office of Violence Prevention Services focuses on national, state, and local violence prevention and public safety policy with an emphasis on excessive use of force, smart gun technology, and a local gun purchasing model. Mayor Edwin M. Lee strives to eliminate gun violence from the city and places the “sanctity of life” at the center of his decision making and policy implementation.</p>

<p class="editable">In response to the officer involved shooting of Mario Woods on December 2, 2015, San Francisco experienced Mayor Edwin M. Lee in partnership with the city residents, leaders from law enforcement agencies, city department, community and faith-based organizations seeks strategies to implement innovative practices that promote public safety to outline key reforms regarding excessive use of force. Mayor Lee’s commitment to the police reforms is reflected in the budget for the next two years (2016/17 & 2017/18).</p>

<p class="editable">Deeply disturbed by gun violence, Mayor Edwin M. Lee is leading the nation by developing San Francisco’s Socially Responsible Purchasing Model. In January 2016, Mayor Edwin M. Lee directed city stakeholders to administratively reform San Francisco’s purchasing protocol to prioritize the procurement of firearms and ammunition from socially responsible manufacturers and dealers. This model will require all potential vendors of firearms and ammunition to demonstrate their commitment to best practices.</p>
