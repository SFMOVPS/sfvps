<h3 class="editable">Police Reform </h3>

<p class="editable">After a series of incidents of national and local police misconduct during 2015, Mayor Lee has advocated for police reforms such as new training and equipment. Furthermore, he has pushed for reforms to happen quickly, and provided funds to make that happen. This office is in charge of monitoring progress on reforms in San Francisco.</p> 

<h4 class="editable">Working with the Community to Create a Reform Plan </h4>

<p class="editable">This office has worked closely with the San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) and other City Departments, the San Francisco Police Officers Association (POA), the US Department of Justice (DOJ), and community and faith-based organizations to create a plan for the new police reforms.</p>

<p class="editable">The reforms include a review and revision of use of force policies and expands training for de-escalation and implicit bias training. Full details about these reforms and others are published <a href="http://sfmayor.org/index.aspx?page=1069">here</a>.</p><h4 class="editable">Providing Funding for Reforms and Violence Prevention</h4>

<p class="editable">In 2016, Mayor Lee allocated $20 million in the two-year budget to fund police reforms and violence prevention services. This funding demonstrates the Mayor&rsquo;s commitment to building trust between police officers and the community, making policing more transparent, and supporting programs that prevent violence. More details about the budget proposal are published <a href="http://sfmayor.org/index.aspx?recordid=1151&amp;page=846">here</a>.</p>

<h3 class="editable">Advocating for Responsible Gun Sales</h3>

<p class="editable">In the wake of mass shootings in California and across the nation, the Mayor has looked for innovative ways to advocate for more responsible gun sales. One approach the Mayor is pursuing is to support gun manufacturers and distributors who follow best practices for responsible gun sales.

</p><h4 class="editable">Using Purchasing Power to Influence Gun Manufacturers and Distributors</h4>

<p class="editable">The City and County of San Francisco, like many other local governments, buys guns. The Mayor and our office are currently developing a way to &ldquo;vote with our dollars&rdquo;, and make sure that when we purchase guns, we support manufacturers and distributors that are doing their part to reduce gun violence.</p> 

<p class="editable">Our office has researched best practices in gun sales so that the city can identify socially responsible gun manufacturers and distributors. Based on this research, our office is creating guidelines called the Socially Responsible Purchasing Model.</p>

<p class="editable">The guidelines are made to help gun purchasers identify socially responsible gun manufacturers and distributors based on proof that they are following best practices in areas like selection and authorization of gun dealers, education of buyers on gun safety and storage, and cooperation with law enforcement.</p>

<h4 class="editable">Leading the Way for Other Gun Purchasers</h4>

<p class="editable">The Mayor and our office hope that our Socially Responsible Purchasing Model will be adopted by or inspire other local and national gun purchasers. Together, gun purchasers can use their purchasing power to advocate for more responsible gun sales.</p>
