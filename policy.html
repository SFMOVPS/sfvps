<h3 class="editable">Police Reform </h3>

<p class="editable">In December 2015, Mario Woods was fatally shot by a member of the San Francisco Police Department. In April 2016, bigoted text messages sent by a few members of the SFPD came to light. Given these events, Mayor Lee has forcefully advocated for reforms in the way the SFPD trains and directs its officers about the use of force. Furthermore, he has pushed for reforms to happen quickly, and provided funds to make that happen.</p>

<p class="editable">Our office is in charge of monitoring progress on these reforms. Working with the Budget Office and other advisers, we have also provided recommendations on funding for those reforms.</p>

<h4 class="editable">Working with the Community to Create a Reform Plan </h4>

<p class="editable">Following the shooting of Mario Woods, Mayor Lee and our office have worked closely with the San Francisco Police Department, other city departments, the US Department of Justice, and community and faith-based organizations to create a plan for reforming how San Francisco police use force in law enforcement.</p>

<p class="editable">The reforms include a review and revision of the SFPD’s guidelines on use of force, and expanding training for SFPD officers on de-escalation and implicit bias. Full details about these reforms and others are published <a href="http://sfmayor.org/index.aspx?page=1069">here</a>. 

</p><h4 class="editable">Providing Funding for Reforms and Violence Prevention
</h4>

<p class="editable">In his proposed budget for 2016-2017, the Mayor put $17.5 million dollars to fund police reforms. This funding demonstrates the Mayor’s commitment to building trust between police officers and the community, making policing more transparent, and supporting programs that prevent violence.</p>

<p class="editable">The budget includes $4.4 million for the SFPD to use for training and equipment like tasers and body cameras. It also includes $11.3 million to support violence prevention programs including the IPO Employment Program and the Crisis Response Team. More details about the budget proposal are published <a href="http://sfmayor.org/index.aspx?recordid=1151&page=846">here</a>.</p>

<h3 class="editable">Advocating for Responsible Gun Sales</h3>

<p class="editable">In the wake of mass shootings in California and across the nation, the Mayor has looked for innovative ways to advocate for more responsible gun sales. One approach the Mayor is pursuing is to support gun manufacturers and distributors who follow best practices for responsible gun sales.

</p><h4 class="editable">Using Purchasing Power to Influence Gun Manufacturers and Distributors</h4>

<p class="editable">The City of San Francisco, like many other local governments, buys guns. The Mayor and our office are currently developing a way to “vote with our dollars”, and make sure that when we purchase guns, we support manufacturers and distributors that are doing their part to reduce gun violence.</p> 

<p class="editable">Our office has researched best practices in gun sales so that the city can identify socially responsible gun manufacturers and distributors. Based on this research, our office is creating guidelines called the Socially Responsible Purchasing Model.</p>

<p class="editable">The guidelines are made to help gun purchasers identify socially responsible gun manufacturers and distributors based on proof that they are following best practices in areas like selection and authorization of gun dealers, education of buyers on gun safety and storage, and cooperation with law enforcement.</p>

<h4 class="editable">Leading the Way for other Gun Purchasers</h4>

<p class="editable">The Mayor and our office hope that our Socially Responsible Purchasing Model will be adopted by or inspire other local and national gun purchasers. Together, gun purchasers can use their purchasing power to advocate for more responsible gun sales.</p>
