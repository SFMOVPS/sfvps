<h4>Street Violence</h4>
<p>We participate in the city’s Crisis Response System, and lead the Street Violence Response Team. Together, the Crisis Response System and the Street Violence Response Team make sure that people impacted by street violence get the support they need in the short and long-term.</p>
<h4>Human Trafficking</h4>
<p>Together with <a href="http://www.sfgov.org/dosw">the Department on the Status of Women</a>, we lead <a href="http://sfgov.org/dosw/mayors-task-force-anti-human-trafficking">the Mayor’s Task Force on Anti-Human Trafficking</a>. This Task Force includes experts from 17 city departments and 23 community-based organizations. The Task Force is a place for these groups to discuss policy issues and issues around providing services to victims of human trafficking.</p>
<h4>Family Violence</h4>
<p>Experts in domestic violence, child abuse, and elder / dependent adult abuse chair <a href="http://sfgov.org/dosw/family-violence-council">the Family Violence Council</a>. The Council makes recommendations for policies and services, and our office works to implement those recommendations.</p>

<h3>Facilitating Work on Human Trafficking</h3>
<p>In just one 6 month period in 2014, government and non-profit agencies identified 248 individuals who were confirmed or suspected survivors of human trafficking. </p>
<p>These numbers are unacceptable. San Francisco’s government and non-profit agencies are uniting to fight human trafficking in our city. One way the Mayor’s Office of Violence Prevention Services contributes is by working with <a href="http://www.sfgov.org/dosw/">the Department on the Status on Women</a> to lead <a href="http://sfgov.org/dosw/mayors-task-force-anti-human-trafficking">the Anti-Human Trafficking Task Force</a>.</p>
<p>The Anti-Human Trafficking Task Force includes representatives from organizations that help victims of human trafficking, from the police department, and from other community organizations. The Task Force is a place for people working against human trafficking to discuss policy, to plan joint efforts, and to create a shared vision for how they’ll address problems.</p>
<h4>Recent Anti-Human Trafficking Work</h4>

<p>Various organizations collect data on different aspects of human trafficking. In the past, that has made it difficult to get a complete picture of the situation. The Task Force recently worked to gather and organize data to create a report on human trafficking in San Francisco. <a href="http://sfgov.org/dosw/sites/sfgov.org.dosw/files/HT%20Report_FINAL.pdf">This report</a> is the first of its kind and the most complete view and analysis of human-trafficking in San Francisco to date.</p>
<p>During large events where many people come into the city temporarily, there can be an increase in human trafficking activity. To prepare for the Super Bowl 50 in 2016, the Task Force worked to educate the local hotel industry on how to identify people being trafficked.</p>
<p>Massage parlors have a history of being abused for human trafficking. To make it harder for that to happen, the task force has worked to develop rules about massage parlor permits and inspections.</p>

<h3>Uniting Organizations Against Family Violence</h3>
<p>Family violence is defined as violence between people in a relationship, between married people, between adults and children, or between the elderly and their caregivers. Different city departments, including the Mayor’s Office of Violence Prevention Services work on addressing and preventing family violence.</p>
<p>Once a quarter, the city departments that work on this issue meet for <a href="http://sfgov.org/dosw/family-violence-council">the Family Violence Council</a>. At the Council, different departments update one another on the work they are doing. The Council meetings give departments a chance to catch up and coordinate work.</p>
