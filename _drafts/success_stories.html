                                <h4 class="dpi-edit" data-900-id="18kipi">Josh</h4>
                                <p class="dpi-edit" data-900-id="mludb8">Josh is a San Francisco native who grew up in the Bayview. In 2008, his father passed away and he dropped out of high school. Then he says, "things happened that landed me on probation." Before the IPO program, he was working for a contractor, doing construction work around the city. But his driver's license was suspended for parking tickets he couldn't pay, so he couldn't get to the construction sites that he needed to. He went back to job searching.</p>
                                <p class="dpi-edit" data-900-id="ojiu2m">Then, in 2013, Josh's probation officer told him about the Youth Employment Program. During the program, he took the training  seriously. He says, "job readiness training really helped me out cause I probably would have been shy or nervous and didn't know what to say [in interviews]...and now I'm able to tell them what I'm good at or what I'm bad at or what I need to brush up on and I'm able to tell them I'm a team player, I'm good at working with others..." On the job he says, "I didn't miss a day. I was on time every day, and back from lunch on time. And never gave them mouth. I was "Yes, what do you want me to do? OK, I'll do it." "</p>
                                <p class="dpi-edit" data-900-id="7ced21">Meanwhile, Josh's case manager "[helped] me with everything. If I needed help with my license, if I needed help with the diploma, if I needed help with anything. Anything I needed help with they would help me with it...looked out for me all the way through." He says "Whatever I needed help with, that's what I asked for. If I didn't need help with some things, I didn't ask for it. You know, there's other people who need help."</p>

                                <p class="dpi-edit" data-900-id="typy0c">"It's really great. You know, coming from the neighborhood that I come from, this is something that you want to do besides all the things that can land you in jail or a bunch of deaths are going in the neighborhoods that I live in, so me avoiding that is the best part. Especially with me having two kids. I have a son and a daughter so I would like to you know give them a better place to live in the future."</p>

                                <p class="dpi-edit" data-900-id="ksgub1">"And I'm able to help my mom when she needs stuff. It's been good. It's been a real big help. It changed my life a lot. I wasn't able to help pay rent at one point, and now I'm paying rent by myself sometimes, or getting groceries by myself, or taking care of responsibilities now. I'm just knocking everything down, all the debts that I was in, my license, and the loan I took out when I was in City College. And I'm able to pay off my debts and get back right with society. I love the iPO program, it's a great program, I think everyone should go through it if they're down in life, or not thinking they can do anything with life, I think you should try the IPO program because they're willing to help you as long as you're willing to help yourself."</p>

                                <h4 class="dpi-edit" data-900-id="jwkge3">Lonnell</h4>

                                <p class="dpi-edit" data-900-id="k31usc">When Yolanda, a case manager at YCD, talks about Lonnell, you know she knows him well. She explains "He graduated from high school from Philip Burton. He went away to college. He's the oldest sibling of 4 brothers. He was kind of, he always had family support, but being the older one, he always had to fend for his family and his younger brothers. So it was really hard for him when he went to college. He left, and he, part of him was like what am I doing, I'm leaving my brothers, they need me. He didn't want them to get caught up in any of the violence that goes on in the communities."</p>

                                <p class="dpi-edit" data-900-id="kydm4o">"Once he told me something that I'll never forget. He said that he's had a lot of people say that they're going to help and be concerned but never to that level where I was like, calling to check on him all the time." "You know I had people say they were going to help me but never to this point. You really like, want me to succeed. And I'm like, yes, that's what it's about."</p>

                                <p class="dpi-edit" data-900-id="d6ikev">"I just seen that fire in him and I didn't want that flame to go dim. Myself, I had a bunch of passions growing up. I always had a passion for helping people. I always wanted to go to fashion school and do all these other things. But like Lanel, I wanted to stay behind and make sure my family was okay. Make sure my brothers were safe. And, sad to say, my brother was murdered in 2006, just, you know from the gang violence. And I wanted to be a solution, not a problem to it. And...how can we help these guys?... if I can save one or two, then I know that I've done something right. And I know I can't save the world but I try to do my best. Just uplift, encouragement, whatever I can do, I'm going to try to do it"</p>

                                <p class="dpi-edit" data-900-id="2n9d1l">"When I first left for school, I left in 2008, I went to an all-black college...Then there was a couple of events that happened at home that was kinda terrible that made me felt as though I need to be home for the next couple years. So I did."</p>

                                <p class="dpi-edit" data-900-id="tun68p"> It's really just gang violence. Like I said, I'm community based. I can't say I'm not from. That's where I live at, I'm born and raised there. And you have to defend yourself no matter what, I can't deny that. There will be all type of situations...</p>

                                <p class="dpi-edit" data-900-id="ik5rd5">I played basketball and I played football. I travelled all around this country playing basketball. I have played football for philip burton and I have a little college experience. It was like, as long as I play sports, you leave the community stuff at home and when you go off you go off. I wouldn't say I was looking for trouble. No, I was never looking for trouble. So as far as violence, it didn't approach me as much, but that was because of where I directed my energy.</p>

                                <p class="dpi-edit" data-900-id="mq3i5g">Now, you know, there's you get into fights and there's things that you have to do but you direct your energy where you want. And that's really where...that's why I pay attention to....I got little brothers, you know. I refuse to allow them to follow those footsteps in a direction that I didn't want to be in. So, I knew that there was something outside to do other than being out in the streets and stuff. And that's really what it was.</p>

                                <p class="dpi-edit" data-900-id="sgom0g">"One day, I was in my dorm, and my little brother was texting me and told me that somebody passed away. And it affected me because it was so close to home. And when you see somebody that's close to you."</p>

                                <p class="dpi-edit" data-900-id="5cc3xu">So my sister, she had my niece, even though her father passed away. So I'm the father figure in my niece and nephew's lives. So I had a lot to think about. It was a lot to think about.</p>

                                <p class="dpi-edit" data-900-id="7oyyf7">Not, before the program. Not at first. Before the program I didn't want a job. I didn't want it...It was more as, you know, a close friend in the neighborhood. He's actually an older guy, he's more of a mentor. And he told me that he basically needed me to do something for him and that was this program and that's kinda how I got here. He called me, telling me, Lanel, I need you to do this for me.</p>

                                <p class="dpi-edit" data-900-id="b7u9cd">I was never really late. I didn't miss days. If there was a situation, I would call. I just did the little things, just knowing how to have a job. And honestly those were the sort of things they taught you at YCD... As far as the work, it was easy, it was fun really. I like working. I don't mind sweating and being dirty and stuff. </p>

                                <p class="dpi-edit" data-900-id="vrccc8">Now I think I'm a little more developed. I think I'm ready to be a consistent college student. I know what can happen in just two years and that's what I'm pushing for.</p>
