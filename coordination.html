<h3>Supporting Individuals Impacted by Violence</h3>
<h4>Street Violence</h4>
<p>We participate in the city’s Crisis Response System, and lead the Street Violence Response Team. Together, the Crisis Response System and the Street Violence Response Team make sure that people impacted by street violence get the support they need in the short and long-term.</p>
<h4>Human Trafficking</h4>
<p>Together with <a href="http://www.sfgov.org/dosw">the Department on the Status of Women</a>, we lead <a href="http://sfgov.org/dosw/mayors-task-force-anti-human-trafficking">the Mayor’s Task Force on Anti-Human Trafficking</a>. This Task Force includes experts from 17 city departments and 23 community-based organizations. The Task Force is a place for these groups to discuss policy issues and issues around providing services to victims of human trafficking.</p>
<h4>Family Violence</h4>
<p>Experts in domestic violence, child abuse, and elder / dependent adult abuse chair <a href="http://sfgov.org/dosw/family-violence-council">the Family Violence Council</a>. The Council makes recommendations for policies and services, and our office works to implement those recommendations.</p>

<h3>Responding to Street Violence</h3>
<p>After a violent incident, it’s essential for organizations work together to make sure that individuals and communities affected by violence get the services they need. Both the Crisis Response System and the Street Violence Response Team (SVRT) respond to violent incidents. The Office of Violence Prevention Services helps different city departments and organizations involved in the response system work together smoothly.</p>
<h4>How the Crisis Response System Works</h4>
<p>The Crisis Response System (CRS) is a partnership between many city departments and local organizations. The CRS makes sure that people affected by a violent incident get the services and support they need immediately. Violent incidents are incidents such as shootings, homicides, or serious assaults.</p><p>After a violent incident, CRS members reach out to community members to understand the circumstances of the event. CRS members work to understand what sort of support victims and the community needs, both immediately and long-term. By facilitating communication with the community and between organizations, the CRS makes sure that city departments and local organizations services are matched with the community’s needs.</p><p>At the hospital, CRS members make sure that victims and families get the support they need. The CRS also takes action to prevent any violence at the hospital. This prevents the incident from getting worse or causing other incidents and keeps everyone safe.</p><p>In the hours and days following a violent incident, the Crisis Response System makes sure that all the organizations that are a part of it have the best possible understanding of a situation. This shared understanding allows the organizations to create a plan which ensures that the victim, their family, witnesses, and the community receive the support they need.</p>
<h4>How the Street Violence Response Team (SVRT) Works</h4>
<p>The Crisis Response System begins work immediately after a violent incident. On the other hand, the Street Violence Response Team works continuously. The Mayor’s Office of Violence Prevention Services brings together the team every week to review violent incidents and coordinate ongoing work on these incidents.</p><p>A longer-term response includes making sure that individuals affected by an incident continue to get the services they need in the weeks and months afterwards. This might include getting individuals counseling for trauma, ongoing case management, or support finding housing or employment. Just as the SVRT looks at what individuals need in the weeks and months following an incident, they also look at what communities need. For example, they might plan a community event to address trauma in the wake of an incident.</p><p>The Street Violence Response Team also looks for possible factors that are impacting the safety of an area. For example, the team might decide that an area needs better street lighting based on the circumstances of incidents nearby. Because the team works continuously, members monitor follow-up for the incidents that they have reviewed in the past.</p><p>The Street Violence Response Team helps people affected by violent incidents recover, and prevents future violence.</p>
<p>The members of the Street Violence Response Team are representatives from city departments, community-based, and faith-based organizations. More specifically, the team includes representatives from the <a href="http://sfmayor.org/">Mayor’s Office</a>, the Board of Supervisors, the <a href="http://www.sanfranciscopolice.org/">San Francisco Police Department</a>, the <a href="http://sfgov.org/adultprobation/">Adult Probation Department</a>, the <a href="http://sfgov.org/juvprobation/">Juvenile Probation Department</a>, the <a href="https://www.sfdph.org/dph/default.asp">Department of Public Health</a>, the <a href="http://www.sfha.org/">Housing Authority</a>, the <a href="http://www.sfdistrictattorney.org/">District Attorney’s Office</a>, the <a href="http://www.sfusd.edu/">San Francisco Unified School District</a>, the <a href="/outreach.html">Street Violence Intervention Program</a>, faith-based leaders, and others.</p>

<h3>Facilitating Work on Human Trafficking</h3>
<p>In just one 6 month period in 2014, government and non-profit agencies identified 248 individuals who were confirmed or suspected survivors of human trafficking. </p>
<p>These numbers are unacceptable. San Francisco’s government and non-profit agencies are uniting to fight human trafficking in our city. One way the Mayor’s Office of Violence Prevention Services contributes is by working with <a href="http://www.sfgov.org/dosw/">the Department on the Status on Women</a> to lead <a href="http://sfgov.org/dosw/mayors-task-force-anti-human-trafficking">the Anti-Human Trafficking Task Force</a>.</p>
<p>The Anti-Human Trafficking Task Force includes representatives from organizations that help victims of human trafficking, from the police department, and from other community organizations. The Task Force is a place for people working against human trafficking to discuss policy, to plan joint efforts, and to create a shared vision for how they’ll address problems.</p>
<h4>Recent Anti-Human Trafficking Work</h4>
<img src="images/human-trafficking-report.jpg">
<p>Various organizations collect data on different aspects of human trafficking. In the past, that has made it difficult to get a complete picture of the situation. The Task Force recently worked to gather and organize data to create a report on human trafficking in San Francisco. <a href="http://sfgov.org/dosw/sites/sfgov.org.dosw/files/HT%20Report_FINAL.pdf">This report</a> is the first of its kind and the most complete view and analysis of human-trafficking in San Francisco to date.</p>
<p>During large events where many people come into the city temporarily, there can be an increase in human trafficking activity. To prepare for the Super Bowl 50 in 2016, the Task Force worked to educate the local hotel industry on how to identify people being trafficked.</p>
<p>Massage parlors have a history of being abused for human trafficking. To make it harder for that to happen, the task force has worked to develop rules about massage parlor permits and inspections.</p>

<h3>Uniting Organizations Against Family Violence</h3>
<p>Family violence is defined as violence between people in a relationship, between married people, between adults and children, or between the elderly and their caregivers. Different city departments, including the Mayor’s Office of Violence Prevention Services work on addressing and preventing family violence.</p>
<p>Once a quarter, the city departments that work on this issue meet for <a href="http://sfgov.org/dosw/family-violence-council">the Family Violence Council</a>. At the Council, different departments update one another on the work they are doing. The Council meetings give departments a chance to catch up and coordinate work.</p>
